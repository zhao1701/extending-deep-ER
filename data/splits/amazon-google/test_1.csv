animations from start to finish -- it simplifies the animation process and empowers artists to create their projects faster and easier than ever before. you'll be surprised by how quickly you can get started. packed with ready-to-use anime style characters you can create your own animations right out of the box. tutorials and sample files show you how to maximize anime studio pro's powerful features giving you the jump start you'll need to begin your first project. once you feel at home with the mechanics of the software you'll be ready to move on to your own art. sketch your original characters and backdrops scan in and import graphics or if you use a pen tablet you can recreate the sensation of drawing on paper. built with vector graphics anime studio pro 5 provides power and flexibility with multiple layering and the capacity to resize images without sacrificing quality. another powerful element of anime studio pro 5 is the use of bones. using the software's bone rigging system you can add a skeleton to any image to bring it to life. with anime studio pro 5 there is no need to create new art for each individual frame as you animate -- just adjust the bones to your desired position and the program will generate the movement for you. you can also count on anime studio pro 5 to help direct your animated action with an intuitive timeline. setting your movements to a timeline makes scene changes feel seamless and natural so the plot of your animated short is easier to follow. no animation is complete without an audio soundtrack. anime studio pro 5 helps you add emotion and style to your animations by adding sound in wav and aiff formats. and once you've completed a project you can publish your results for a variety of media including video tv and web formats. design and layout anime studio pro 5 gives you total control over your canvas and makes it easy for you to organize and complete your project using layers. with this intuitive software under your belt you can set up your 2d canvas to the exact dimensions you want. and with anime studio pro you can even turn your canvas into a 3d stage with x y and z coordinates to easily produce your animation with added depth and dimension. using anime studio pro's vector-based graphics you can freely adjust canvas resolution and size without losing image quality. if you're already accustomed to other graphics-driven programs such as photoshop or quark you'll be pleased with anime studio pro's familiar layer-based workflow. it is an easy and efficient way to organize your assets and create your animation and you'll save time by reusing your art. simply create an asset once and place it on a layer then refer to that layer any time you need to reuse a piece of art. advanced layer features include switch layers which allows you to rotate among all the layers in a set and shows only one layer a time. this saves you a great deal of time when animating body movements or facial expressions. use anime studio pro to rig your characters objects and scenes with the revolutionary bone system that makes the animation process easier than ever before. bones create a skeleton that determines joints or flex points in your artwork. you can then manipulate the bones to move the image into new positions without time-consuming redraws. simple tools let you design dynamic character movement. stop thinking of your drawings as fixed static images -- with anime studio pro you drawings become like soft rubber with stiff wires inside that help you move and position the objects on the screen. bones are never displayed in the final render they're just used as a tool during the animation process. and to make the process smoother and easier to follow you can organize your project using keyframe animation and a timeline. then all you need to do is position your image on the canvas and manipulate the timeline. the software will interpolate the motion between positions for you to create a smooth-flowing graceful transition from one movement to the next. in anime studio pro you can also fine tune your animations with powerful timeline controls such as onion skins tweening and graph mode. and with the pro version you can create animations of any length. once you complete a project you can finish it for web tv film and still formats. with anime studio pro you can output your finished work to a variety of standard formats such as avi mov and flash (swf export for vector based animations). studio pro also makes it easy to transfer your work to other popular graphics programs to utilize assets for other projects or to add color to your art. pro exports to jpg bmp png an tga file formats and even allows you to export your artwork as layered psd files. animation techniques traditional animation was created by drawing frames one after another each frame drawn slightly different from the last. anime studio pro helps you simulate frame-by-frame animation yet drastically reduces the time required from traditional animation. designed to mimic real skeletal structure the anime studio pro bones are interdependent so when you adjust one bone all the other connected bones will move in response. the bone-rigging feature also uses spring-like simulation to calculate dynamic bone movement. this makes a wide range of movements seem real such as jumping waving flabby body parts and bouncing hair. you can also take advantage of anime studio pro's switch layers function to work with a combination of connected movements that occur along a timeline. this is particularly valuable for animating body movements or facial expressions such as lip-synch animations when each graphical layer can be a mouth shape for a different sound. an additional animation feature includes cycling keyframe interpolation which will automatically cycle a section of animation and repeat it over again as many times as you wish. another feature includes onion skins that show the position of objects in your scene at a given point in time -- just click on any point in the timeline to see the onion skins in anime studio pro. in anime studio pro you can use actions -- little clips of animation that are associated with a layer or group of layers -- to create reusable animations for movements that you expect to use repeatedly. tweening adjusts the pace of movements within a given action so you can slow it down or speed it up. and pro's graph mode allows you to inspect an animation curve plotted as values on a graph. this helps evaluate acceleration changes in direction and other properties of motion. anime studio pro includes over 200 sample files and is filled with content that includes the standard anime studio content files such as anime characters aya and winsor backgrounds animation other characters scenery and props. anime studio pro also includes extra samples such as 3d animals 3d movies and samples provided by users that serve as great starting points.,efrontier,199.99

resizing an image larger than the original size requires that new pixels be created. this process is called interpolation or up-rezzing. there are many mathematical ways called algorithms to do this. the most common method used by default by many pixel editing applications is called bicubic interpolation. bicubic along with with its newer variants bicubic smoother and bicubic sharper work by averaging a small group of neighboring pixels to determine the color value of the new pixels to be added. while this technique is fast it does not distinguish edges so there is a uniform loss of sharpness and detail across the image. genuine fractals and bicubic smoother comparison genuine fractals 5 patented algorithms work differently. it starts by analyzing ever-decreasing sizes of pixel blocks in your image looking for repeating natural patterns at different sizes. these are known as fractals. fractals are common naturally repeating patterns found everywhere. for example a river system viewed from space has the same shape as the veins in a leaf. these are both fractal patterns at very different scales. the great thing about fractal patterns is once you find them they can be scaled to any size without loss in detail. this allows genuine fractals 5 to resize your image over 1000% without losing sharpness and edge detail. unmatched image resizing genuine fractals 5 can resize your images over 1000% and still maintain sharp edges and minute details. to give you an idea of how big that is you could take a full-frame image from a six megapixel image and resize it to make a print of 10x15 feet at 180 ppi! it is a must for any photographer or artist who makes large format or poster sized prints. it is also great for journalists sports and wildlife photographers who may need to take a cropped section of an image and still make a high-quality print from it. cropping can leave you with very few pixels to work with. if you where to crop this professional 12 megapixel image to keep just the antelope you would be left with only four megapixels of information barely enough to make a good 5x7 print. however with genuine fractals 5 you could make a print over 6 feet tall. save hard disk space and bandwidth increasing the size and resolution of a file results in a larger file on disk. you can reduce the disk space needed and bandwidth when transferring files by saving your files into the genuine fractals 5 .stn format which provides lossless and visually lossless wavelet compression to cut your file size in half or more. now you can store twice as many images on your hard drive and upload them in half the time. long time users of genuine fractals remember having to save files as a .stn file before being able to scale the image. in genuine fractals 5 any file that is opened in photoshop can be scaled in one easy step without having to save as a .stn file first. batch processing with genuine fractals 5 genuine fractals 5 can be automated easily by using a photoshop action. by default genuine fractals 5 remembers its last used setting--however you can create a photoshop action to resize an entire folder of images at the same time. not just for photographers genuine fractals 5 is not just for photographers but anyone who needs to resize images. graphic designers can end the everyday problem of receiving low resolution images from clients for high resolution print work. genuine fractals 5 can also help you create tradeshow and billboard graphics from average sized images. genuine fractals 5 is also commonly used by service bureaus as well as law enforcement and architects for resizing small files.,onone software,159.95

confront the legion on otherworldly battlefields. although only one race has been revealed blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. on the other hand many details have been released about the new continent outland. players last visited outland in warcraft iii: the frozen throne alongside illidan as he conquered the pit lord magtheridon's domain. players will also gain access to quel'thalas the region to the northeast of the forsaken lands where the blood elves reside. blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead. blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion though the exact number has not yet been determined. one upcoming dungeon that has players excited is karazhan which is located within medivh's tower. because medivh has played such a central role in warcraft lore blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what karazhan contains. as for battlegrounds blizzard has released very little information. however they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the caverns of time. blood elves: the new race thousands of years ago the exiled highborne landed on the shores of lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of quel'thas. these high elves as they called themselves created a fountain of vast magical energies within the heart of their land -- the sunwell. over time they grew dependant on the sunwell's unstable energies regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past. during the third war the villainous prince arthas invaded quel'thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. his undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. in addition he used the sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead lich kel'thuzad thereby fouling the sunwell's mystical waters. the few elven survivors realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power grew increasingly volatile and desperate. in the midst of the elves' darkest hour came kael'thas sunstrider the last of quel'thalas' royal bloodline. kael as he was commonly known knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. renaming his people blood elves in honor of their fallen countrymen kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. in search of a new destiny for his people kael'thas ventured to the remote world of outland where he encountered the fallen night elf illidan. under illidan's watchful eye kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power. unfortunately the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the alliance to shun them. thus the remaining blood elves on azeroth look desperately to the horde to help them reach outland where they can reunite with kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them. outland: the new continent once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs all that remains of draenor is the scattered wastes of outland. following the second war the alliance invaded draenor by crossing through the dark portal. to their horror they discovered that ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten horde to newer unspoiled worlds. as the alliance forces closed in around him ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. however his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of draenor to pieces. nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the third war -- the fallen night elf illidan discovered that huge chunks of draenor still existed floating upon the astral winds of the twisting nether. after his defeat at the hands of the evil prince arthas illidan fled to the remnants of draenor and dubbed them outland. he quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of ner'zhul's gateways. though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably arthas the new lich king and the remaining lords of the burning legion. for now outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes primitive orcs and powerful arcane creatures of the nether itself. agents of the burning legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending burning crusade to scour all life from the universe. what else can expected? blizzard has tantalized warcraft players with the brief glimpse into the burning crusade's storyline. will these heroes find friends or foes? what dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the dark portal? and what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible burning crusade? these and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing warcrafters.,blizzard entertainment,39.99

b00008mops,cisco security desktop agent ( csa-b250-dtop-k9 ),the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a microsoft windows 2000 server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console. the cisco security agent resides between the applications and the kernel enabling maximum application visibility with minimal effect on the stability and performance of the underlying operating system. the agent's unique architecture intercepts all system calls to file network and registry sources as well as to dynamic run-time resources such as memory pages shared library modules and component object model (com) objects. the agent applies unique intelligence to correlate behaviors of these system calls based on rules that define appropriate or acceptable behavior for a specific application. this correlation and subsequent understanding of an application's behavior is what allows the software as directed by the security staff to prevent new intrusions. when an application attempts an operation the agent checks the operation against the application's security policy making a real-time allow or deny decision on its continuation and determining if logging of the request is appropriate. security policies are collections of rules that it and/or security administrators assign to protected servers and desktops on an enterprise-wide basis or individually. these rules provide safe application access to required resources. by combining security policies implementing distributed firewall operating system lockdown integrity assurance malicious mobile code protection and audit event collection capabilities in default policies for servers and desktops the cisco security agent provides defense-in-depth protection for exposed corporate systems. because protection is based on blocking malicious behavior,cisco systems (ciscopro),0.0

b00008mopv,cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ),the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console.,cisco systems - enterprise,0.0

b00008mopv,cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ),the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console.,cisco systems - enterprise,0.0

experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp home edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows media player 9 series makes it easy to enjoy music video and broadband content with enhanced security.,microsoft software,199.99

information from other sources and in different ways other difficulties can arise. for instance because most people don't have a way of digitally capturing unstructured information they often print out web research and store information in file folders or on desks which is difficult to find later and inaccessible when you're away. and sharing information with others can be challenging--even when

communication coordination and information sharing can challenge group effectiveness and productivity. teams often rely on e-mail messages to share information causing confusion and bloated e-mail inboxes. tasks action items agendas and issues stored within static documents or document management systems are difficult to update track and access and they prevent multiple people from working with

sending your notes as html so that anyone with an e-mail client or web browser can view them and stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private and help ensure privacy with password protection. you can even use onenote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard enabling virtual teams to work together in real time viewing and editing

sending your notes as html so that anyone with an e-mail client or web browser can view them and stay in control of your information by choosing which notebooks to share with your teammates and which to keep private and help ensure privacy with password protection. you can even use onenote 2007 as a shared digital whiteboard enabling virtual teams to work together in real time viewing and editing

resizing an image larger than the original size requires that new pixels be created. this process is called interpolation or up-rezzing. there are many mathematical ways called algorithms to do this. the most common method used by default by many pixel editing applications is called bicubic interpolation. bicubic along with with its newer variants bicubic smoother and bicubic sharper work by averaging a small group of neighboring pixels to determine the color value of the new pixels to be added. while this technique is fast it does not distinguish edges so there is a uniform loss of sharpness and detail across the image. genuine fractals and bicubic smoother comparison genuine fractals 5 patented algorithms work differently. it starts by analyzing ever-decreasing sizes of pixel blocks in your image looking for repeating natural patterns at different sizes. these are known as fractals. fractals are common naturally repeating patterns found everywhere. for example a river system viewed from space has the same shape as the veins in a leaf. these are both fractal patterns at very different scales. the great thing about fractal patterns is once you find them they can be scaled to any size without loss in detail. this allows genuine fractals 5 to resize your image over 1000% without losing sharpness and edge detail. unmatched image resizing genuine fractals 5 can resize your images over 1000% and still maintain sharp edges and minute details. to give you an idea of how big that is you could take a full-frame image from a six megapixel image and resize it to make a print of 10x15 feet at 180 ppi! it is a must for any photographer or artist who makes large format or poster sized prints. it is also great for journalists sports and wildlife photographers who may need to take a cropped section of an image and still make a high-quality print from it. cropping can leave you with very few pixels to work with. if you where to crop this professional 12 megapixel image to keep just the antelope you would be left with only four megapixels of information barely enough to make a good 5x7 print. however with genuine fractals 5 you could make a print over 6 feet tall. save hard disk space and bandwidth increasing the size and resolution of a file results in a larger file on disk. you can reduce the disk space needed and bandwidth when transferring files by saving your files into the genuine fractals 5 .stn format which provides lossless and visually lossless wavelet compression to cut your file size in half or more. now you can store twice as many images on your hard drive and upload them in half the time. long time users of genuine fractals remember having to save files as a .stn file before being able to scale the image. in genuine fractals 5 any file that is opened in photoshop can be scaled in one easy step without having to save as a .stn file first. batch processing with genuine fractals 5 genuine fractals 5 can be automated easily by using a photoshop action. by default genuine fractals 5 remembers its last used setting--however you can create a photoshop action to resize an entire folder of images at the same time. not just for photographers genuine fractals 5 is not just for photographers but anyone who needs to resize images. graphic designers can end the everyday problem of receiving low resolution images from clients for high resolution print work. genuine fractals 5 can also help you create tradeshow and billboard graphics from average sized images. genuine fractals 5 is also commonly used by service bureaus as well as law enforcement and architects for resizing small files.,onone software,159.95

b00008mops,cisco security desktop agent ( csa-b250-dtop-k9 ),the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a microsoft windows 2000 server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console. the cisco security agent resides between the applications and the kernel enabling maximum application visibility with minimal effect on the stability and performance of the underlying operating system. the agent's unique architecture intercepts all system calls to file network and registry sources as well as to dynamic run-time resources such as memory pages shared library modules and component object model (com) objects. the agent applies unique intelligence to correlate behaviors of these system calls based on rules that define appropriate or acceptable behavior for a specific application. this correlation and subsequent understanding of an application's behavior is what allows the software as directed by the security staff to prevent new intrusions. when an application attempts an operation the agent checks the operation against the application's security policy making a real-time allow or deny decision on its continuation and determining if logging of the request is appropriate. security policies are collections of rules that it and/or security administrators assign to protected servers and desktops on an enterprise-wide basis or individually. these rules provide safe application access to required resources. by combining security policies implementing distributed firewall operating system lockdown integrity assurance malicious mobile code protection and audit event collection capabilities in default policies for servers and desktops the cisco security agent provides defense-in-depth protection for exposed corporate systems. because protection is based on blocking malicious behavior,cisco systems (ciscopro),0.0

choose from many built-in characters to grease your animation wheels and get a feel for the software's capabilities. this program includes everything aspiring artists need to create top quality animations from start to finish -- it simplifies the animation process and empowers artists to create their projects faster and easier than ever before. you'll be surprised by how quickly you can get started. packed with ready-to-use anime style characters you can create your own animations right out of the box. tutorials and sample files show you how to maximize anime studio pro's powerful features giving you the jump start you'll need to begin your first project. once you feel at home with the mechanics of the software you'll be ready to move on to your own art. sketch your original characters and backdrops scan in and import graphics or if you use a pen tablet you can recreate the sensation of drawing on paper. built with vector graphics anime studio pro 5 provides power and flexibility with multiple layering and the capacity to resize images without sacrificing quality. another powerful element of anime studio pro 5 is the use of bones. using the software's bone rigging system you can add a skeleton to any image to bring it to life. with anime studio pro 5 there is no need to create new art for each individual frame as you animate -- just adjust the bones to your desired position and the program will generate the movement for you. you can also count on anime studio pro 5 to help direct your animated action with an intuitive timeline. setting your movements to a timeline makes scene changes feel seamless and natural so the plot of your animated short is easier to follow. no animation is complete without an audio soundtrack. anime studio pro 5 helps you add emotion and style to your animations by adding sound in wav and aiff formats. and once you've completed a project you can publish your results for a variety of media including video tv and web formats. design and layout anime studio pro 5 gives you total control over your canvas and makes it easy for you to organize and complete your project using layers. with this intuitive software under your belt you can set up your 2d canvas to the exact dimensions you want. and with anime studio pro you can even turn your canvas into a 3d stage with x y and z coordinates to easily produce your animation with added depth and dimension. using anime studio pro's vector-based graphics you can freely adjust canvas resolution and size without losing image quality. if you're already accustomed to other graphics-driven programs such as photoshop or quark you'll be pleased with anime studio pro's familiar layer-based workflow. it is an easy and efficient way to organize your assets and create your animation and you'll save time by reusing your art. simply create an asset once and place it on a layer then refer to that layer any time you need to reuse a piece of art. advanced layer features include switch layers which allows you to rotate among all the layers in a set and shows only one layer a time. this saves you a great deal of time when animating body movements or facial expressions. use anime studio pro to rig your characters objects and scenes with the revolutionary bone system that makes the animation process easier than ever before. bones create a skeleton that determines joints or flex points in your artwork. you can then manipulate the bones to move the image into new positions without time-consuming redraws. simple tools let you design dynamic character movement. stop thinking of your drawings as fixed static images -- with anime studio pro you drawings become like soft rubber with stiff wires inside that help you move and position the objects on the screen. bones are never displayed in the final render they're just used as a tool during the animation process. and to make the process smoother and easier to follow you can organize your project using keyframe animation and a timeline. then all you need to do is position your image on the canvas and manipulate the timeline. the software will interpolate the motion between positions for you to create a smooth-flowing graceful transition from one movement to the next. in anime studio pro you can also fine tune your animations with powerful timeline controls such as onion skins tweening and graph mode. and with the pro version you can create animations of any length. once you complete a project you can finish it for web tv film and still formats. with anime studio pro you can output your finished work to a variety of standard formats such as avi mov and flash (swf export for vector based animations). studio pro also makes it easy to transfer your work to other popular graphics programs to utilize assets for other projects or to add color to your art. pro exports to jpg bmp png an tga file formats and even allows you to export your artwork as layered psd files. animation techniques traditional animation was created by drawing frames one after another each frame drawn slightly different from the last. anime studio pro helps you simulate frame-by-frame animation yet drastically reduces the time required from traditional animation. designed to mimic real skeletal structure the anime studio pro bones are interdependent so when you adjust one bone all the other connected bones will move in response. the bone-rigging feature also uses spring-like simulation to calculate dynamic bone movement. this makes a wide range of movements seem real such as jumping waving flabby body parts and bouncing hair. you can also take advantage of anime studio pro's switch layers function to work with a combination of connected movements that occur along a timeline. this is particularly valuable for animating body movements or facial expressions such as lip-synch animations when each graphical layer can be a mouth shape for a different sound. an additional animation feature includes cycling keyframe interpolation which will automatically cycle a section of animation and repeat it over again as many times as you wish. another feature includes onion skins that show the position of objects in your scene at a given point in time -- just click on any point in the timeline to see the onion skins in anime studio pro. in anime studio pro you can use actions -- little clips of animation that are associated with a layer or group of layers -- to create reusable animations for movements that you expect to use repeatedly. tweening adjusts the pace of movements within a given action so you can slow it down or speed it up. and pro's graph mode allows you to inspect an animation curve plotted as values on a graph. this helps evaluate acceleration changes in direction and other properties of motion. anime studio pro includes over 200 sample files and is filled with content that includes the standard anime studio content files such as anime characters aya and winsor backgrounds animation other characters scenery and props. anime studio pro also includes extra samples such as 3d animals 3d movies and samples provided by users that serve as great starting points.,efrontier,199.99
